📊 Power BI Dashboard + 🖥️ Interactive Website (Frontend UI)

📝 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive solution aimed at analyzing and improving the mental well-being of students by combining the power of data visualization with an interactive front-end survey platform. It was designed as part of a real-world academic and technical initiative to collect, analyze, and present psychological and academic stress-related insights for students.

The project has two major components:

💡 1. Power BI Dashboard: Data-Driven Storytelling
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard was created using real or simulated student data to:

📈 Track key mental health indicators like anxiety, depression, burnout, stress levels

📍 Use filters (e.g., year, gender, stream, sleep patterns) for custom drill-down insights

📊 Represent risk scores using heatmaps, treemaps, pie charts, bar graphs, and decomposition trees

📌 Enable decision-makers (teachers, counselors, management) to identify at-risk students quickly

📍 Key visualizations include:

Anxiety vs Depression heatmap

Study satisfaction vs CGPA scatter plots

Financial concerns vs Isolation impact

Course workload & sleep deprivation insights

This dashboard offers actionable insights and can guide real-world mental health interventions.

🧠 2. Interactive Survey Website (Frontend UI using HTML, CSS, JS)
A responsive and visually appealing website was developed to:

📝 Collect student inputs in a form-like structure instead of basic bars

✅ Use dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, sliders, and more to make survey experience engaging

🎯 Categorize inputs across Academic Pressure, Social Life, Sleep Patterns, Motivation, Counseling Need, etc.

💡 Generate real-time recommendations based on answers to promote mental wellness

💬 Provide user-friendly feedback with visual tips and a soft pastel UI theme

🎨 Designed with a modern, accessible, and soothing UI color palette

This system acts as the data collection front-end, which can easily integrate with back-end databases or connect directly to Power BI or Python pipelines for further analysis.
